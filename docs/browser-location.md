5. In the **Block** section and the **Allow** sections, you can see which websites you've given geolocation permissions to and revoke them, if needed.

### Opera
Opera uses Google Location Services to track your whereabouts. The first time you go to a website using the browser, it asks you to accept GLS' terms and conditions. After that, Opera will give you the choice of sending your location data, or not, whenever a website requests that information. But, if you want to disable it completely, go to **Settings (Preferences on Mac) > Websites > Location and uncheck Allow websites to request my physical location**.

### Internet Explorer 11
Here's how to disable geolocation services in Internet Explorer 11:

1. Select the **Gear** icon in the upper right-hand corner of the browser window.
2. When the drop-down menu appears, select **Internet Options**.

3. Select the **Privacy** tab.
4. Find the **Location** section under **Privacy Options** and click the checkbox next to **Never allow websites to request your physical location**. When activated, this option instructs the browser to deny all requests to access your physical location data.

5. The **Clear Sites** button is also within the **Location** section. Anytime a website attempts to access your location data, IE11 prompts you to take action. In addition to allowing or denying that individual request, you have the option to blacklist or whitelist the respective website. These preferences are then stored by the browser and used on subsequent visits to those sites. To delete all of those saved preferences and start anew, select the **Clear Sites** button.
 
### Safari for Macs
Safari is the default web browser that ships with all Mac computers. To access or deny access to your physical location in Safari:

1. Click the **System Preferences** option in the Dock.
2. Select **Security & Privacy > Privacy > Location Services**.
3. Enable or disable location services by placing (or removing) a check in front of **Enable Location Services**. You may need to click the lock in the bottom left corner before you can make the changes.
